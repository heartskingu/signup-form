# Signup Form

## This demo was created with Angular 13 and Angular Material

### Disclaimer
There is a known bug with tick() and Angular 13, which is being discussed here: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/44351
So the signup-form.component-spec.ts tests might fail intermittently because of this.

## Running the project locally
You might run the application locally using the command ```npm run start```

And run all tests with the command ```npm run test```

It's also possible to build the application using the command ```npm run build```

---

## Unit Tests
Since TestBed is an Integration Test utility and my objective was to create Unit Tests, all tests were written creating the component/service manually. This isoletes the test logic while also improving its performance.
